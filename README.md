# Videre

A webserver which provides the user with an interface to process streams and files through a deep learning object detection algorithm - yolov3 - and the capacity to save the processed data in a PostgreSQL database.

Done for the final project of a bachelor's degree by @brunu97, @DiogoFreeDom, @Reinaldo1998 and myself.

## Installation

You will need PostgreSQL and the dependencies listed on requirements.txt.
Just execute run.py with Python 3.6+ and you should be good.
Also, works with CUDA.
